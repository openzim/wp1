# ZIM Files

A ZIM file is _an archive of wiki or other web page content for offline usage_.
You can read more about ZIM files on the [OpenZIM website](https://wiki.openzim.org/wiki/OpenZIM). Generally speaking, users of the WP1 site will create ZIM files from their [Selections](selections.md) in order to browse the articles that were selected, offline, using a [ZIM reader](https://wiki.openzim.org/wiki/Readers)

# Creating a ZIM file from a WP1 Selection

In order to create a ZIM file, you must first have a [Selection](selections.md) that has been **materialized**. Your Selection has been materialized when a "Download TSV" link appears in its row on the Selections page. After that, you can click the link to "Create ZIM" to begin the process of creating a ZIM file.
