# Wikipedia WP 1.0 Engine

The Wikipedia WP 1.0 Engine is located at
[wp1.openzim.org](https://wp1.openzim.org). It is largely concerned with
aggregating **ratings** for various
[WikiProjects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject). There is
also the ability for logged-in users to create **content selections**.

This documentation is divided into two major sections: one is the [end user
documentation](user), for those who are interacting with the WP 1.0 website, and
the other is for [developers](developer) who wish to understand or contribute code to the
open source operation of the site.

The code for WP 1.0 is [hosted on Github](https://github.com/openzim/wp1) and
released under a GPLv2 or later license.
